# Snake Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the Pygame library. The game involves controlling a snake to eat food while avoiding colliding with walls or the snake's own body. The game ends when the snake hits a wall or collides with its own body.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run the game, you will need:

* Python 3

* Pygame library
### Installing
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the Pygame library by running the following command in your terminal:

### Running the game

   "python snake_game.py"


The game window will open, and you can use the arrow keys to control the snake.
